# Asyncio (understanding how it works)

Here is the official Python documentation for [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).

### Subset of the main _API asyncio_ offers to end-user developers

1. Starting the __asyncio__ event loop.
2. Calling _async_/_await_ functions.
3. Creating a _task_ to be run on the loop.
4. Waiting for multiple tasks to complete.
5. Closing the loop after all concurrent tasks have completed.
